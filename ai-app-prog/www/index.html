<title>AI Application Programming Ruby port</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In an effort to learn more about AI programming techniques, I'm trying to port M. Tim Jones' <a href="http://www.charlesriver.com/titles/aiapp.html">AI Application Programming</a> examples from C to Ruby. 

<p>The relevant chapters are:
<ul>
<li>Simulated Annealing
<li>Adaptive Resonance Theory
<li>Ant Algorithms
<li>Neural Networks and the Backpropagation Algorithm
<li>Genetic Algorithms
<li>Artificial Life
<li>Expert Systems
<li>Fuzzy Logic
<p>Updated 10/2/03: About 50% done, code is <a href="http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ai-app-prog/src/ch9/?cvsroot=ai-app-prog">here</a>.  Should consider writing something to generate graphs to illustrate the effects of applying the membership functions.
<li>The Bigram Model (Hidden Markov Models)
<li>Intelligent Agents
</ul>

<p>Tim was kind enough to pass on the book's <a href="ai-errata.pdf">erratum</a> to me - current as of Sep 30 2003.

<p>Here are some general thoughts on porting.  I'm a novice at both Ruby and C, so take these with a grain of salt.
<ul>
<li>The code in this book (so far) doesn't use pointers, setjmp(), or other hairy C stuff - it's mostly just loops and functions.  This makes porting it a lot easier.
<li>If someone wanted to do this and preserve speed, it'd probably be best to just write Ruby extensions that wrap the AI stuff (thx to Rich Kilmer for this comment)
<li>So far I've pretty much just ported it straight over - only adding a few objects as necessary.  There's some stuff that could turn into some nice objects, i.e., the voltage membership functions in the fuzzy logic examples.
</ul>
