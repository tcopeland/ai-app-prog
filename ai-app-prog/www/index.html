<title>AI Application Programming Ruby port</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In an effort to learn more about AI programming techniques, I'm trying to port M. Tim Jones' <a href="http://www.charlesriver.com/titles/aiapp.html">AI Application Programming</a> examples from C to Ruby.  I'm planning to port these in no particular order.

<p>The relevant chapters are:
<ul>
<li>Simulated Annealing
<li>Adaptive Resonance Theory
<li>Ant Algorithms
<li>Neural Networks and the Backpropagation Algorithm
<li>Genetic Algorithms
<li>Artificial Life
<li>Expert Systems
<li><a href="#fuzzy">Fuzzy Logic</a>
<li>The Bigram Model (Hidden Markov Models)
<li>Intelligent Agents
</ul>

<p>Tim was kind enough to pass on the book's <a href="ai-errata.pdf">erratum</a> to me - current as of Oct 06 2003.

<h3>General musings</h3>
<ul>
<li>The code in this book (so far) doesn't use setjmp() or doubly-indirect pointers or other hairy C stuff - it's mostly just loops and functions.  This makes porting it a lot easier.
<li>Watch for C code like this:
<pre>
if (foo) {
}
</pre>
It needs to be translated to
<pre>
if (foo != 0) {
}
</pre>
in Ruby.  In other words. "non zero" in C needs to be translated to "not nil and not zero" in Ruby.
<li>If someone wanted to do this and preserve speed, it'd probably be best to just write Ruby extensions that wrap the AI stuff (thx to Rich Kilmer for this comment)
<li>So far I've pretty much just ported it straight over - only adding a few objects as necessary.  There's some stuff that could turn into some nice objects, i.e., the voltage membership functions in the fuzzy logic examples.
<li>Ruby is _so_ much less wordy than C - not having to type all the parentheses and semicolons and such is really nice.
<li>Writing more tests will alleviate some problems I'm having - i.e., forgetting the "@" on a instance variable.  It's kind of an odd situation, though... I don't really understand how some of the algorithms work, so writing tests for them is hard since I have to step thru the entire function with sample values.  I feel like the tests I'm writing are too high-level or something.
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 9 - Fuzzy Logic</h3>
<p>Updated 10/2/03: Battery charger simulation functionally complete, code is <a href="http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ai-app-prog/src/ch9/?cvsroot=ai-app-prog">here</a>.  Below is an Open Office-generated graph showing the relationships between the battery's voltage and temperature - you can see when the fast charger kicks in and when it falls back to trickle charge mode.  TODO:
<ul>
<li>Use a Ruby library to generate charts on demand
<li>Write more tests
<li>Refactor away the redundancies in the membership function code
</ul>
