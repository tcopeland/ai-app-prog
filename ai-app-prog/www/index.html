<title>AI Application Programming Ruby port</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In an effort to learn more about AI programming techniques, I'm trying to port M. Tim Jones' <a href="http://www.charlesriver.com/titles/aiapp.html">AI Application Programming</a> examples from C to Ruby.  I'm planning to port these in no particular order.

<p>The relevant chapters are:
<ul>
<li>Simulated Annealing
<li>Adaptive Resonance Theory
<li>Ant Algorithms
<li>Neural Networks and the Backpropagation Algorithm
<li>Genetic Algorithms
<li>Artificial Life
<li>Expert Systems
<li><a href="#fuzzy">Fuzzy Logic</a>
<li>The Bigram Model (Hidden Markov Models)
<li>Intelligent Agents
</ul>

<p>Tim was kind enough to pass on the book's <a href="ai-errata.pdf">erratum</a> to me - current as of Oct 06 2003.
<p>This project is hosted by RubyForge, forums and such-like are <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ai-app-prog/">here</a>.

<h3>General musings</h3>
<ul>
<li>The code in this book doesn't use setjmp() or doubly-indirect pointers or other hairy C stuff - it's mostly just loops and functions.  This makes porting it a lot easier.
<li>Watch for C code like this:
<pre>
if (foo) {
}
</pre>
It needs to be translated to
<pre>
if (foo != 0) {
}
</pre>
in Ruby.  In other words. "non zero" in C needs to be translated to "not nil and not zero" in Ruby.
<li>I'm porting in several steps:
<ol>
<li>Do an initial "raw" port by just translating C to Ruby
<li>Pick a blob of associated data items, refactor them into a Ruby class
<li>Add tests, back to step 2
</ol>
<li>Ruby is _so_ much less wordy than C - not having to type all the parentheses and semicolons and such is really nice.
<li>If someone wanted to do this and preserve speed, it'd probably be best to just write Ruby extensions that wrap the AI stuff (thx to Rich Kilmer for this comment)
<li>Writing more tests will alleviate some problems I'm having - i.e., forgetting the "@" on a instance variable.  It's kind of an odd situation, though... I don't really understand how some of the algorithms work, so writing tests for them is hard since I have to step thru the entire function with sample values.  I feel like the tests I'm writing are too high-level or something.
</ul>

<h3>Chapter 9 - Fuzzy Logic</h3>
<p>Updated 10/16/03: Battery charger and predator prey examples complete, code is <a href="http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/cgi/viewcvs.cgi/ai-app-prog/src/ch9/?cvsroot=ai-app-prog">here</a>.  
<ul>
<li>The predator/prey example was fun because I had to relearn some trigonometry.  Also, I had to tweak the membership functions a bit - the first time through I made the center spike profile too wide and so the predator kept waiting too long to turn towards the prey.
<li>To run the programs and generate the graphs, move to the <code>src/ch9</code> directory and do a <code>./fuzzy.rb > predator_data.txt && ./predator_gnuplot</code> to regenerate the predator graph, or a <code>./fuzzy.rb -battery > battery_data.txt && ./battery_gnuplot</code> to regenerate the battery graph.
</ul>
<p>Battery charger example: below is a graph (thanks gnuplot!) showing the relationships between the battery's voltage and temperature - you can see when the fast charger kicks in and when it falls back to trickle charge mode.

<p>Predator/prey example: below is an image of the predator seeing the prey and turning towards it.
